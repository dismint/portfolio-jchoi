# Response to Matthew

Great discussion about the direction that companies tend to go in - I've also frequently noticed that companies care about development velocity first and then the direction afterwards. I actually wrote about this more fully in my blog post, and reading your response really fleshed out how I thought about the difference between moving fast and moving with direction. 

Companies **do** often move quickly without thinking until the consequences catch up to them. I talked about how companies could inject "direction check ups" for certain projects within their company to nudge the design in the right direction. The analogy I brought up was balancing a stick on y our hand - if you respond to all the movements quickly, then you will have no trouble balancing it, but if you don't do anything for long enough then the stick will fall. In this case, your example makes perfect sense. Companies think that they can increase the granularity of their moral check ins so that they can move fast, but in doing so they forget about them and move too slowly, and eventually the moral debt catches up to them majorly.

I might push back against part of your first paragraph - I find it hard to believe that a company such as Google didn't think about the consequences of their actions when they were making the search engine. I would consider the core part of Google's identity to be its search engine and the algorithm behind it (PageRank). The algorithm makes deliberate choices. The way it chooses to rank pages with the decay factor to prioritize popular websites is an intentional design choice made with scale in mind - the power of Google's engine really shines because it was able to provide amazing results quickly in a large and rapidly evolving internet. 

However I do believe they fell into the fallacy that you mentioned. They perhaps got complacent and did not check back in with tweaking the algorithm as the internet and their values continued to evolve. As a result they most likely landed in a position where technical debt has now accumulated into a moral debt.
