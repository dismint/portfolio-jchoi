# Project 2: Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals
Name: Outfinity (Outfit + infinity)

Audience: Fast fashion consumers who have concerns about not wearing all of their clothes and are interested in finding new and unique ways to style their existing clothes instead of purchasing more.

Value: Existing solutions either require users to pay for styling advice from professional stylists, generate styling advice using AI, or do not provide ways to obtain styling advice or inspiration other than viewing others’ outfits. We give our users a way to get crowdsourced “fresh eyes” on their closets for free so that they can give their clothes new life.

## Comparables
![tinder comparison](https://i.imgur.com/X4ZpdU4.png)
- Tinder: Tinder allows users to swipe left and right to determine if they want to match with a person or not. We can adopt this feature in our app by allowing users to swipe left and right on the results from challenges they set to quickly and easily save the outfits they like.

![spotify wrapped comparison](https://i.imgur.com/27Xa8dZ.png)
- Spotify Wrapped - gives yearly data on users’ listening habits. We can do something similar where we give users yearly aggregate data about their shopping and wearing habits (for example, what articles of clothing they wear the most).

![wishbone comparison](https://i.imgur.com/8rSRs0Q.png)
- Wishbone - Wishbone allows users to pick between two choices with a visual representation. We can allow users to create wishbone-like polls where others can pick between two outfit options that they’re deciding between.

![yummly comparison](https://i.imgur.com/PdGc3bt.png)
- Yummly - Yummly allows users to search for recipes based on what ingredients they have on hand. We could allow users to search for outfits based on a specific item, which would be useful especially on vacations when only a certain subset of your closet is available.

![tips comparison](https://i.imgur.com/1lP9xbp.png)
- Tips - Apple’s Tips app provides tips and hacks on using the interface. We could instead provide tips about sustainability with clothing, such as what fabrics and brands are sustainable.

![dti comparison](https://i.imgur.com/ZhuEgMF.png)
- Dress to Impress (Roblox) - Users compete to fit a theme and have their models walk out one by one to display their outfits. In our app, we can display the challenge submissions one by one, superimposed onto a model to better show what the outfit might look like when worn.

![airbuds comparison](https://i.imgur.com/qB6vCrx.png)
- Airbuds - Users can see what their friends are listening to and react – we can do something similar where we have what items each user is wearing visible to their friends, who can react and comment on each OOTD.

![pepper comparison](https://i.imgur.com/x2N1Lko.png)
- Pepper - An app where users can share recipes and share them with other friends, family, or users. Their interface is very lightweight, supporting only the necessary actions on each page, which we could adopt in our application as well. The app also includes interesting markers on many key UI features, such as progress bars, making it easy for the user to see the state of an object without clicking into anything. We would also implement this by having badges or challenge timers display directly on the profile or objects without having to click in.

![whisper comparison](https://i.imgur.com/rOtWorv.png)
- Whisper - A now removed app from the App store that used to let users converse anonymously. Its main strength was being able to advertise chat rooms that users would join without knowing the other person’s identity. Outfinity can also use the principles of how to advertise and match similarity in our algorithm to make sure that users who have similar fashion tastes or come from similar cultures get matched together, even when anonymous.


## Feature Brainstorm
1. Closets – Users can add clothes to their closet and save their favorite outfits as well.
2. Challenges - Users can style other users’ closets to create outfits depending on set parameters (for example, for a certain event or for a certain mood/style), and can also set their own challenges for upcoming events or just everyday wear. The user who sets the challenge can rate the results and pick their favorite outfit, or the one that they actually wore.
3. Achievements/Badges - Users can get achievements for being selected as the best outfit in challenges, not buying clothes for a long time, buying sustainably, and other examples of good behavior on the app. They can display these on their profile.
4. Tagging/Labeling - Users can tag challenges, outfits, and clothing items with tags denoting style (such as how conservative the outfit is) and practicality (such as what type of weather or occasion the outfit is suited for).
5.  Miniclosets - Users can pick a subset of their closet to be a “minicloset.” They can create challenges using these miniclosets so that other users can only pick out of this subset. This is useful for going on vacation when you only bring a small subset of your closet but still want outfit ideas.
6. Repurpose Tutorials - Users can upload videos showing other users how to tailor their own clothes (for people who have a hard time finding clothes that fit them) and/or repurpose clothes in different ways (like turning skirts into shirts or making them into a bag, etc.)
7. Calendar Challenge maker - We can make an integration with Google Calendar, so that when users create an event in Google calendar, our app can automatically generate a challenge for that event.
8. Outfit Timeline - This feature will allow users to see what outfits they have worn in the past whether it is a year, a season, a month, or a week.
9. Forgotten Clothes Reminder - Users will get notifications periodically of clothes they haven’t worn in a long time to spark new outfit ideas and encourage users to wear forgotten clothes.
10. Outfit Recap - Like Spotify Wrapped, at the end of the year, we can give users fun data about their strengths and weaknesses on the app to further encourage sustainability and highlights areas in which they can improve. Some facts we can include are most worn outfit, what clothing items they have worn the least, challenge they’ve created with most participants, most liked outfit you made for someone else, etc.
11. Unused clothing sale - For clothing items that the user has not worn in over 6 months (and only for these items), users have the option to put this item into their profile “store” for other users to buy.
12. Style Quiz - Users swipe right/left on outfits they like or don’t like in order to find out what style they lean toward and inspiration to lean more into this style, or to change to another.
13. Sustainability Tips - There will be a section of the app with helpful tips for users to be more sustainable in buying clothes, repurposing clothes, and donating clothes similar to Apple’s Tips. We can also give these suggestions periodically through banners in the app.
14. Piece Challenge - user can make a challenge where people must use a clothing item of their choosing in their outfit suggestions
15. Donation center locator - This feature will help users locate trusted clothing donation centers that prioritize good social and environmental impact.
16. OOTD - when logging your daily outfit, you have the option to also film a fun “Outfit of the Day” video for friends.
17. Search by item - users can search their saved outfits by a specific item if they are excited about wearing that item on a given day.
18. Outfit polls - Like the Wishbone app, users can create polls for other users to vote on in order to decide which outfit to wear.
19. Collaborative Closets - Two (or more) users can share items or entire closets with each other so that they will be available to both users to include in challenges or to style themselves (useful for roommates or siblings that can easily share clothes).
20. Sustainability Score - Users can optionally input how they acquired clothes (secondhand, new) and from where, and the app will give them a sustainability score depending on these factors and their rate of consumption of clothes. Users can compare their sustainability to those on their friends list in order to encourage them to improve.
21. Featured Item - Users can opt into having a featured item randomly selected from their closet which they are challenged to create an outfit with everyday.
22. Similarity Score - Users can get “similarity scores” with other users depending on how similar their closets are (with respect to tags, closet composition, etc.). They can select their favorite outfits to display to users with high similarity scores with themselves to serve as inspiration.
23. Substitute Clothing Recommendations - Users can input a picture or description of an item of clothing they want to buy, and other users can recommend a similar item from the original user’s own closet to serve as a substitute (for example, if they want to follow a trend but don’t want to buy a new item, they might be able to substitute a similar item if they style it a certain way).
24. Closet Drop/Swap - In the event of a sudden style change or a weight gain/loss, users can advertise that they want to get rid of a lot of clothes in bulk and other users can either offer money or their own clothes to ensure that the clothes go to someone who will wear them.
25. Mood Based Clothes - Users can keep track of what kind of days they tend to wear various outfits on, this can be used by the application to recommend past outfits on a given day that might suit the user based on their prior preferences.
26. Goals and Milestones: Long term goals like persistent logins, competing in daily contests, or being an generally active contributor to the site. Users can get additional rewards, such as special badges, for maintaining a streak in the app.
27. Virtual Try-On: Use AR or have different pre-rendered models to have a better sense of how different clothes look in different scenarios or bodies. 
28. Style Bio - Users might want to know what kind of thought went into producing an outfit that they really liked in one of their challenges. Even with anonymized interactions, users can request a “style bio” for a winner of their challenges to understand how to style clothes like them.
29. Weather Match - Use the current weather in the user’s region to recommend people and challenges that more closely match their current conditions. The user can optionally opt in our out to see other climates / weather conditions as well.
30. Culture Match - Similar to above, but have users’ feed cater toward any cultural preferences in clothing, and potentially match against others who are in a similar position and might be more knowledgeable. 
31. Size Swap - If users do not wear an item because it’s only one size off, they can put out an advertisement looking for someone with the same item with the same problem in the opposite direction and arrange a swap.

### Clothing [User, Label]
**Purpose**: represents an article of clothing owned by a user with labels representing metadata about it.
**Operational Principle**: a user can upload a picture of an article of clothing they own and select labels that describe the clothing, and the clothing can be found by its labels.

### Outfit-ing [Item, User]
**Purpose**: allows for users to create an outfit out of a combination of items and can suggest them to other users.
**Operational Principle**:  users can add 2+ items together to create an outfit. Outfit must have a top and bottom or one-piece and shoes.

### Closet-ing [Item, User]
**Purpose**: users can group items into closets (or miniclosets) representing a set or subset of items they own
**Operational Principle**: after a user creates a closet (and before they delete it), the user can use the addItem action to add clothing items to this closet such that when the user views this closet, the item will be there. 

### Challenging [User]
**Purpose**: allows users to set objectives for other users to fulfill.
**Operational Principle**: after a user creates a challenge, it will be available for other users to see and submit entries to. After some time, the original user can select one or more winning entries.

### Achievementing [User]
**Purpose**: allow a user to be rewarded for good behavior and display these awards to other users.
**Operational Principle**: after a user behaves in a way that should be encouraged, they are given an achievement that reflects this behavior that is visible to other users.

### Labeling [Item]
**Purpose**: provide information about an item.
**Operational Principle**: an item is labeled with a label that provides information about it and this item can be found by the label.
