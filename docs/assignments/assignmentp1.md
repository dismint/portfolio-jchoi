# Project 1: Impact Case

## Team Contract

- Expected level of achievement and effort for each team member (what grades do you expect to get? how much time do you plan to put in?)
    - The team would like to target an A on this assignment, and we will put in the appropriate amount of time to achieve this. Based on the individual assignment we estimate this should be around 10 hours a week.
- Personal goals for each team member (building a great app? learning a particular skill?)
    - We would like to make an app that we are proud of and that we would use ourselves! We are all excited about the topic of our app, so we hope that this app will live up to that excitement.
- Frequency, length and location of team meetings
    - Mondays from 2:00-3:00 pm at the Stata
    - With our mentor Mondays from 3:00-3:45 pm in Stata
    - Thursdays from 12:30-2:30 pm in Stud
- How quality of work will be maintained (reviewing each others’ code? team review meetings? pair programming?)
    - We will give updates during our Monday meeting (for the upcoming Wednesday deadline) and show preliminary progress to make sure everyone is on track and creating good quality work. We will also keep each other accountable in pairs (pairs are Jennifer and Tiana, Annie and Justin).
- How tasks will be assigned, and what to do if deadlines are missed
    - Task assignments will be discussed during our Thursday meeting, and everyone will be given an equal amount of work. 
    - Any issue with deadlines should be discussed during our Monday meeting (or over text if Monday has passed), and other members will take on more work if some member is truly unable to do their assigned part. This will prevent missed deadlines.
- How decisions will be made and any disagreements resolved
    - Decisions will be made as a group during our Thursday meeting to give members as much time as possible to work. Disagreements will be resolved as a group through open discussion, but in the unlikely case that we cannot come to an agreement, we will try a team vote or consulting our mentor for the best path forward.

## Initial Impact Case

1. The problem of fast fashion consumption and its environmental impact is important because it leads to excessive waste, pollution, and unsustainable resource use as people buy new clothes to keep up with trends instead of making the most of their existing wardrobes. From initial survey of our team members, we all agree that we only wear a small percentage of the clothing we own. This habit reflects a broader pattern of underutilized wardrobes that drives people to buy new clothes rather than styling what they already own.
2. Our solution to address this problem is an app that encourages users to style outfits using clothes they already own. While some existing apps allow you to log the items in your closet and style your clothes to create new outfits, our novelty and unique impact will come from the idea of styling outfits for others. Some User X looking for inspiration will put out a challenge (ex. an everyday outfit, date night outfit, halloween costume), and others will take on this challenge using items from User X’s closet. After the challenge ends, User X will choose a winning outfit to wear!
3. We believe this is a good solution because it shifts focus away from buying new items and toward creatively using what one already has. The fast fashion problem at hand arises from the fact that we get bored of our clothes and fall into repetitive styling patterns, leading us to seek novelty by purchasing new items instead of reimagining the items we already own. This tendency perpetuates fast fashion consumption. However, reimagining the clothes you've been wearing in the same way for a while can be tough, so we help offer a fresh perspective by allowing other users to style outfits for you using your wardrobe. This provides a fun, game-like experience that makes outfit creation social and interactive. It also offers users trendy styling ideas from other fashion-minded users, helping them rediscover their own clothes with renewed inspiration and avoid the urge to buy new items.
4. We could measure closet utilization and addition of new clothing items to prove that this solution effectively reduces the need for fast fashion purchases and promotes sustainable wardrobe practices. One idea for how to execute metric tracking for closet utilization would be to ask users to log their outfits everyday so that we can track if more items in their closet are being worn more often. Another way to track this could be to ask users to categorize each piece of clothing by how often they wear it, then have them periodically update these categorizations. To track the addition of new clothing, we can monitor how often users add new items to their closets, allowing us to assess whether their consumption rate decreases over time.

## Research

- The problem of clothes people own being unworn is extremely prevalent; a [study](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/people-do-not-wear-at-least-50-percent-of-their-wardrobes-according-to-study/2018081638356) of 18,000 households in over 20 countries found that the lowest average percentage of unworn clothing items per country was 53%, and in the US specifically, on average 82% of clothes have not been worn in the last year.
    - People also tend to dramatically overestimate the percentage of their closet they wear: in the same study, Americans believed that only 43% of their clothes went unworn.
- Why do we buy clothes we never wear?
    - According to an [article](https://money.com/why-we-buy-clothes-we-never-wear/) by a consumer psychologist, there are four main reasons why this happens:
        - Consumers ignore major flaws with the item or are tempted by a discount, then take it home and find that it doesn’t work in their wardrobe. This happens most frequently with luxury items or statement pieces.
        - Consumers purchase for a fantasy version for themselves or for who they want to be.
        - Consumers don’t wear an item because they don’t want to get it dirty or ruin it.
        - Consumers buy while drunk and can’t return the items.
- The majority of solutions for inspiration in outfits are not based around users’ existing closet.
    - Popular social media apps such as Instagram or Pinterest focus on showing users potential outfits from others.
    - Websites such as [LikeToKnow](https://www.shopltk.com/) exist as a way for content creators and platform partners to suggest outfits and premade combinations to users, but do not offer styling based on preexisting wardrobes.
- There do exist solutions that involve uploading part of a user’s closet to reduce the problem of unworn clothes.
    - The list of [wardrobe apps or closet apps](https://www.myindyx.com/blog/the-best-wardrobe-apps) indicates that they generally require users to catalog their existing wardrobe (with varying levels of post-processing) and allow users to track what they wear and when, as well as style and plan outfits with their closet.
    - These apps sometimes use AI to provide suggestions, but a lot of the time they rely on human stylists to suggest outfit combinations. However, they often charge fees for these services or otherwise monetise their app to pay for the services of the stylists.
    - Some apps do have social features that allow users to view friends’ closets and outfits. However, editing and creating outfits can only happen within a user’s own closet, and the extent to which users can interact are limited to taking inspiration from others’ closets.
    - Additionally, the focus of many existing applications encourages users to buy more items. App algorithms will often recommend similar clothes, or potential new avenues for styles to the user. 

## VSD Analysis

- Since users will be taking pictures of their clothes, there’s a risk of brand tags being visible, which could lead to unintended brand promotion. Some users might misuse the app by intentionally showcasing specific brands, making the app be used for indirect advertising rather than sustainable fashion inspiration. This could encourage users to buy new items when they see something they like in another closet, which goes against the app’s goal of promoting reuse and creativity with existing pieces. Additionally, this could lead to promotion of unsustainable brands, as many widely purchased brands may not follow eco-friendly practices. To prevent this, we could encourage users to blur or crop out tags and include a reporting feature to flag items with brand tags showing.
- The app will likely encounter both cultural and geographic challenges. Some cultures require people to dress more conservative, which could influence what types of outfits users feel comfortable sharing and suggesting for others. Additionally, people in different climates have different clothing needs, such as breathable outfits for hot, humid weather versus layered options for colder climates. To address this, we can add customizable tags for each user’s closet and challenges to indicate things like climate preferences or conservatism levels. Users could set these preferences as defaults and modify them as needed for specific challenges, ensuring suggestions align with their style and comfort.
- Because our app requires users to expose much of their closet to others, social pressures may arise. Users might feel the need to buy more clothes to present a richer, more diverse style, harming the app’s goal of encouraging users to repurpose their existing wardrobe. These pressures could motivate users toward consumerism rather than sustainable choices. To address this, we could introduce an option for users to create challenges anonymously or limit closet visibility to certain followers or friends. Additionally, rewards could encourage sustainable choices, such as badges for going a certain time without buying new clothes or for featuring older items in outfits. Lastly, since the app’s widespread use could raise data privacy concerns, especially if closet contents could be exploited, we should anonymize user data and advise against sharing personal information, such as brand names, prices, or location, in clothing descriptions or profiles.
- Since users rely on suggestions from others for outfit ideas, there’s a risk they may become less confident or creative when it comes to styling their own outfits. To encourage individual creativity, we could add a feature allowing users to view their own closet and put together outfits independently, not just in response to challenges. To further inspire self-styling, a randomization feature could show combinations of items from their closet, sparking new ideas and encouraging experimentation with existing pieces.
- Our app’s challenge-based approach to creating outfits means users would need to plan challenges ahead of time for any upcoming events, which could reduce the convenience of quickly choosing an outfit. This approach could create a value tension between our sustainability goals and the need for convenience in daily life. To balance this, users could save all outfits they like from a challenge, not just the favorite they choose to wear. Additionally, they could input outfits they enjoy wearing regularly, building a library of preplanned looks from both their own and other users’ suggestions, making it easy to browse and quickly select an outfit when needed. This would encourage re-wearing and styling items in new ways without compromising on convenience.

## Interview Questions / Plan

### General Questions:
- How would you describe your style? Do you have a style?
- What places do you like to shop at?
  - Why? (Cheap? Name brand? Trendy?)
- About what percentage of the clothes in your closet do you wear regularly?
  - Followup: What is stopping you from wearing a higher percentage?
- How often do you feel like you repeat the exact same outfits?
  - Followup: Have you reworn your clothes in an unconventional way? If so, how? If not, why not?
- What fashion trends do you like to partake in?
  - Followup: How has this influenced your shopping habits?
- Where do you get your fashion inspiration?
  - Do you/would you ever take fashion advice from others? Who? Tell us about it.
  - Have you given someone else fashion advice? Tell us about it.
    - If not, is there a specific reason why? 
  - Would you be willing to wear an outfit someone else picked out from your closet?
- If you had a magic wand that could help you achieve your fashion goals most effectively or change the situation most dramatically, what would it be?

### For specific interviewees:
- Olivia Pampinella
    - Describe the fashion content that you create.
    - How do you stay on top of trends and create content that is relevant to your viewers?
- Yuri Kim:
    - How prevalent is fast fashion in your age group? Why do you think that might be?
    - Do you have items you don’t know how to style but would love to wear more? If so, why is it hard to style?
- Matthew Su
    - Would you trust an outfit made by someone else for a conference / formal occasion?
    - How does the content you create depend on fashion?
- Kiara Fufunan
    - Do you have trouble finding clothes in your size? Do you alter your clothes to fit?
    - How do environmental concerns affect the ways in which you shop for clothing?

## Interview Findings

- As compared to research, it appears that all participants saw significantly higher wearage rates, with all wearing at least 30% of their wardrobe. Certain interviewees saw even higher rates such as Matthew (80%) and Yuri (90%).
    - Wearage rate is perhaps not the best measure of closet utilization: Matthew remarked that, in line with the Pareto principle, 20% of his closet saw 80% of wearings. In particular, Matthew remarked that just because he wore a given piece of clothing once or twice, did not mean it was a regular part of his rotation of outfits.
    - Factors such as change in climate (Kiara, who moved to California) and closet composition (Kiara and Olivia, who have more statement pieces or large closets) could also put negative pressure on closet utilization unrelated to excess consumption of clothes.
    - Yuri and Kiara both mentioned that they couldn’t find clothes in their closets and simply forgot about them, resulting in them going unworn.
- Age is an important factor in how quickly closets evolve. As Olivia noted, there was a huge influx of clothes after her growth spurt, most of which have gone out of style. It’s likely that certain moments in a person’s life will have higher consumptions of clothes, such as puberty or entry into the workforce.
- There is a barrier to entry in both giving and receiving advice. Most interviewees had a neutral response to being asked whether they would take fashion advice, with many never having experienced either giving or receiving advice outside of select occasions. In everyday life, there may be some discomforts with asking others for fashion advice or offering it, especially unsolicited. Yuri points out that she gets advice from the people she trusts, which is a small pool. There appear to be openings in creating anonymous and low effort ways to give personalized fashion advice.
- Olivia pointed out that she would be surprised if someone could style her basics in a way that she hadn’t already thought about. Other interviewees also seemed interested in the idea that an outside perspective might bring a fresh take to their fashion.
- Where our interviewees got their fashion inspiration from varied significantly.
    - Olivia, who is into fashion in an influencer context, gets a lot of her inspiration from other influencers and their popular videos, and likes to stay on top of trends for her content.
    - Kiara, who is a hobbyist and studies environmental science, looks to Pinterest, but not necessarily for outfit inspiration, but rather to look for inspiration regarding colors, shapes, and silhouettes in her fashion. She said, “I have so many clothes already, I just want to figure out how to keep them fresh and wear them in new ways.”
	    - In contrast, our younger interviewee Yuri also used Pinterest and Instagram but more for inspiration for specific outfits.
- Our interviewees had different ways in which they engaged with consumerism and buying clothes in general.
    - Most of them (Olivia, Matthew, and Yuri) preferred to shop at fast fashion stores such as Brandy Melville, Forever 21, Zara, and H&M due to budgetary concerns.
	    - Olivia in particular indicated a desire for freshness: “Why would I wear the thing that’s two years old instead of the new shirt I just got?”
    - Kiara, as an environmental science major, chose to buy everything except underwear secondhand from thrift stores like Savers and Goodwill, as well as Depop, and makes a “conscious effort not to shop as much” especially compared to “someone who thinks about fashion as much as [she does].”
        - She has a lot of trouble finding pants in her size but she has this problem buying new as well, so she either alters them herself or tailors to fit.
        - Before she buys things, she tries to think of multiple uses for clothes or ways in which they can be reworn, or new contexts in which they would fit
    - Most of our interviewees (Yuri, Olivia, Kiara) agreed that the longevity of their clothes was an important factor in buying them.

## Revised Impact Case

1. The problem of fast fashion consumption and its environmental impact is important because it leads to excessive waste, pollution, and unsustainable resource use as people buy new clothes to keep up with trends or breathe new light into their closets instead of making the most of their existing wardrobes. Contrary to our initial research, our interviewees wore a higher percentage of their wardrobes than expected, ranging from 33%-90% (even though they could have underestimated this percentage, as in the [study](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/people-do-not-wear-at-least-50-percent-of-their-wardrobes-according-to-study/2018081638356)). Some of our interviewees (Yuri, Kiara) found that they often forgot about clothes they owned due to disorganization or clothes storage habits. Others (Olivia) said that they preferred to wear newer clothes over older ones due to a desire for freshness. These factors can explain why people tend to underutilize their wardrobes and the reasons why they choose to buy more clothes.
2. Our solution to address this problem is an app that encourages users to style outfits using clothes they already own. While some [existing apps](https://www.myindyx.com/blog/the-best-wardrobe-apps) allow you to log the items in your closet and style your clothes to create new outfits, our novelty and unique impact will come from the idea of styling outfits for others. Some User X looking for inspiration will put out a challenge (ex. an everyday outfit, date night outfit, halloween costume), and others will take on this challenge using items from User X’s closet. After the challenge ends, User X will choose a winning outfit to wear! Furthermore, users will even be able to save any inspiring outfits they see in their challenge responses, building a collection of looks for convenient future reference. Our interviewees collectively said they would be open to wearing an outfit styled by someone else, with some enthusiastic about the fresh perspectives an outsider could bring to their existing clothing. In general, finding new uses for existing pieces was important to most of our interviewees.
3. We believe this is a good solution because it shifts focus away from buying new items and toward creatively using what one already has. In our research, we found that consumers often [purchase clothes that don’t fit in their closet or that they don’t know how to style in their everyday life](https://money.com/why-we-buy-clothes-we-never-wear/). This tendency perpetuates fast fashion consumption. However, most of our interviewees indicated that it was difficult to get a fresh take on their closet by themselves, so we help offer a fresh perspective by allowing other users to style outfits for you using your wardrobe. This provides a fun, game-like experience that makes outfit creation social and interactive, thus removing many of the barriers to giving and receiving fashion advice brought up by our interviewees. It also offers users trendy styling ideas from other fashion-minded users, helping them rediscover their own clothes with renewed inspiration and avoid the urge to buy new items.
4. We could measure closet utilization and addition of new clothing items to prove that this solution effectively reduces the need for fast fashion purchases and promotes sustainable wardrobe practices. One idea for how to execute metric tracking for closet utilization would be to ask users to log their outfits everyday so that we can track if more items in their closet are being worn more often. Another way to track this could be to ask users to categorize each piece of clothing by how often they wear it, then have them periodically update these categorizations. There was sentiment from our interviewees (Matthew), that there is a large difference between wearing a piece once or twice as opposed to every day. We can potentially weigh both factors in the overall utilization - both the fraction of the closet that is being worn and the skew towards the most commonly worn pieces. To track the addition of new clothing, we can monitor how often users add new items to their closets, allowing us to assess whether their consumption rate decreases over time. For this, we can also award badges when users go a long time without buying clothes to encourage sustainability.
