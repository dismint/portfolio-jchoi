I love making software and using cool tools that help me work better and faster. I'm a long-time Vim enthusiast (the best text editor in the world) and [BTW I use Arch](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch). Contact me if you have any questions :mega:

## Introduction

The objective of this assignment is to interview **two** different people who use some sort of social media platform, and learn about how they use these platforms. This assignment is also being used for myself to understand further how VitePress works.

As can be seen above, I have inserted a short segment from my personal github page. I will most likely stylize and move this to the homepage as further edits to this site happen. I was very happy to learn that VitePress markdown allows for random HTML injections. I have a [miscellaneous](#miscellaneous) section at the bottom of this assignment for various observations I made about this platform (mostly for myself). 

## Plan

Before starting, I had a hunch I wanted to explore - that some individuals use social media not so much for the social aspect, but for the media. What exactly does this mean? I believe that a large number of people use social media as an alternate Google, as a place to **crowdsource** information. On the extreme end, you can considering something like Wikipedia as a social media platform. Obviously, this is the intended use of the platform, but it is wholly possible that other more social applications such as Facebook are used in a similar way. One prominent example of a social media platform that fills this niche is Reddit. Thus my plan was to learn more about how I can refactor or build new social media applications focused around making good use of vast amounts of crowdfunded information.

I wanted to interview the two people who inspired the line of thinking, which were my mom and younger sister (13). I have watched them passively perform similar actions, so I tried to learn both about their general use of social media, as well as their specific use of social media as a source of information. I believe both use social media similarly, but because of the my sister's youth, she is significantly more tech-savvy, so I expect the particular details of usage to vary greatly between the two. I am also expecting to more easily share stories as family members with shared experiences.

### Interview Questions

::: info
Although not the direct questions that will be asked to each interviewee, these are the core questions that I will aim to answer with the questions I ask.
:::

1. What social media platforms do you use?
2. What do you use these platforms for?
3. Are you an **active** user? (Do you post, comment, etc.)
4. How do you use the platform **passively**? (As an observer, not necessarily contributing)
5. What is an example of a particularly frustrating experience, if possible about [failing] to gather desired information on social media?

## Interview Notes

### Mom

#### Questions

---

1. MileMoa, KakaoTalk, YouTube, Facebook
2. Searching about travel information. Looking for deals / coupons / steals. Entertainment. Learning. Keeping up with friends, children's schooling, community events, news.
3. Not active. Extremely rare post on MilaMoa when something extraordinary happens that could impact a large number of others.
4. Watching videos. Searching for keywords related to interests. Check certain forums **regularly** and periodically to stay up to date on deals / news.
5. Not being able to find a previously seen piece of information. Not being able to find any related content despite knowing it exists (especially on social media platforms with inferior search algorithms).

#### Other

---

- Watches a lot of medium-form documentaries about historical events such as plane crashes.
- Uses YouTube as a secondary Google.

### Sister

1. YouTube, Reddit, Scratch
2. Entertainment. Creating and sharing projects. Personal writing and creativity. Inspiration (other's work, ChatGPT).
3. Private projects on Scratch, share with family or friends but not with the public. Otherwise private (safety).
4. Trying out other people's games and creations on scratch. Watching videos, searching for tutorials. Using ChatGPT to generate art and images (maybe consider this active use?). 
5. ChatGPT being difficult and not generating the desired output, even after prompting multiple times. Not knowing how to phrase search terms to find desired content. Not an organized way to view content in a website like Reddit or YouTube outside of channels / subreddits, searching is super general and not well-defined.

#### Other

- Doesn't really use social media to keep up with friends done in person.
- Uses Reddit as inspiration, often only looks at images and not even at the text.
- Similar use case with YouTube, only watches videos and doesn't read comments or descriptions, sometimes even without sound.
- Using one application for another, YouTube as Spotify, Reddit as Google.

## Reports

As feedback for myself, it would probably be helpful to have more detailed interview notes. I found it hard to take detailed notes without interrupting my focus on the conversation, so I ended up taking "reminder" notes. They worked very well for me now since this assignment and the interviews were done very close to each other, but I imagine the process of trying to remember what happened would be significantly more difficult if they had been further apart, or if I had more interviews to keep track of. In the future, an audio recording with timestamps seems like the best solution. I could note at which points in time important information was shared, and then go back to those points to take more detailed notes after the interview.

### Mom

I had a great time interviewing my mom - I ended up learning a lot about her social media usage that I didn't really expect. I always see her using a website called MilaMoa (Korean forum), and YouTube to catch up on news or to watch educational content, but I didn't realize that she also used these platforms for entertainment. I realized a lot of the video series I binged on YouTube were the same ones that she was hooked on (maybe that says something about the YouTube algorithm). It turns out that although she's not quite tech-savvy as I expected, she still uses the platforms fundamentally the same as someone who might be tech-savvy. Important to note that often times outside assumptions about social media usage, even from family members, can be completely wrong sometimes. She lit up talking about our shared interests, which was a good time for myself as well.

One particularly interesting section from my interview with my mom was a dive into remembering where certain information came from. She said it was a frequent occurrence that she found something interesting, but then soon lost it afterwards. I asked her why she didn't simply bookmark the page, and she responded with "I do, but if I bookmarked everything I wanted to remember, I wouldn't be able to sort through my bookmarks themselves". We had a bit of a back and forth about potential alternatives. I suggested using bookmark folders, she said the onus of organizing each bookmark would be too much, etc. I still think that there were potential solutions, but it was apparently that nothing my mom tried had satisfied her. It's interesting how what I perceived as a solution to a problem isn't necessarily a solution to the same problem for anther person.

### Sister

My sister's interview went much more of the way I had anticipated. I've been the one to help my sister "onboard" to the internet and teach her about safety, so I was relatively sure I knew how she used social media. I was surprised by a couple things however. 

1. An incredible amount of usage (not necessarily reliance) on ChatGPT for **creative** endeavours. 
2. "I don't use social media to keep up with anyone, I use it to keep up with myself and my characters"
3. Primary use of YouTube not as video entertainment, but as a music player.

My sister is a writer and very creative, so her workflow fundamentally differs from the rest of my family, including myself. Perhaps it was mainly due to ChatGPT, but my sister very strongly felt that information querying was becoming too general. That is, instead of searching for exactly what you want, you tell another entity what you want to search for, and that resolves it for you. Often times it feels like this entity is far away, or is some extremely intangible concept that makes it hard to interface with it. 

On the contrary, she said that "[Scratch's] remix systems helps me directly find related content. I did not know this, but apparently you can "fork" an existing project and create a new one from it. This means that a central project can be duplicated multiple times, with all of them sharing a common baseline. This might make it very convenient to find multiple desired projects since they are all related to the same base project.

There was a general sentiment that, "if I want to search for big dogs on Google, I should be able to **filter** for "big" and "dogs", and not ask for "big dogs". We had a short conversation about fuzzy matching and why her mindset might not be the one correct answer, but the overall idea was interesting to me. As the amount of data in our services increases, how should users be interacting and querying the data? Will this continue to get more and more indirect until we have no clue what the underlying data looks like?

## Opportunities

- **Personalized Scraper**: Very similar to the now (temporarily) scrapped Copilot feature, a scraper that tracks phone or browser usage and uses it to "bookmark" everything. You can then use an LLM or just manually search / ask for the things you remembering seeing in the past. On phone this would be much easier, on web there might be browser security concerns.
- **Second Brain [Web]**: Many applications such as `Obsidian` promise to act as your "second brain". This works by linking together small topics and forming a vast web of information that can be displayed and parsed in interesting ways. This could be a potential solution to the problem of "I remember seeing something, but I don't remember where". You could work from familiar tags, topics, or concepts, and try to jump to related topics until you find what you are looking for. In particular, this can lead to a social media platform where you very quickly (time being a potential hindrance as noted by my mom), jot down a note about a link, post, or other online activity, and then tag it or link it to other previous posts by yourself or others to create an interconnected web of information. Interesting implications algorithmically.
- **Platform Boosting**: A social media service where the whole point is to **boost** other people. For a particular topic or subject, you can recommend creators or individuals who are well versed or experts in that area. This will in turn make it easier for others to find them when looking for where to go for resources on a topic. You can imagine this is similar to how Google's PageRank works, except it is a dynamic system built by the users rather than counting pre-existing links. Can have different levels of granularity to make it easier to find people in the field you are looking for.
- **Fact Checker**: Although not as directly motivated by the interview questions, the conversations I had made me interested about **crowdsourced** information. Similar to how Twitter's fact checking system works, this platform would take user content and then have other users verify the content, which can perhaps (with EXTREME care) be done automatically at some point in the future once there is enough data from users. Think of it as an advanced ChatGPT with morals.
