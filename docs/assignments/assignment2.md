## Introduction

In this assignment, I will discuss my proposed project, building off of A1. I have taken feedback from the initial assignment and improved upon several of my ideas, combining them into a single improved project: **Webber**

Webber is a new social media platform, as well as a personal organization system. The goal is to store and share how you use websites on the internet through a mind-map like web of linkages. Through Webber, you will be able to see how you utilize the internet, as well as common patterns and potential improvements to your workflow. You can then share this with your friends or colleagues in addition to seeing their webs if they make it public. 

### Audience

This application is primarily intended for those who use the internet regularly in their **personal** life. It is more generally applicable to all internet users, perhaps even exclusively at **work**, although Webber may not be as impactful in such scenarios. Of course, there is the caveat that the user must use the internet in a prolific manner. My grandmother may use the internet, but if its exclusively to watch YouTube, Webber may not be the best fit, at least in its current design. 

However, this is a broad statement, and most internet users still will not necessarily **need** to use this application. So then, who is it for? Webber is specifically meant for individuals who are **conscious** about their internet usage, and want more information about either 

1. How to use it better based off other users
2. How to use it better based off their own usage

I imagine that the biggest group of users that this will attract to be students or full time employees working in the software or IT adjacent industries.

### Value

Webber allows users to **easily** and **productively** organize their commonly visited internet pages, leading to potential insights and a fun way to visualize your internet usage. As will be further discussed below, Webber takes the best parts of note-taking apps such as Obsidian, and combines it with the social aspect of platforms like Reddit. In my research, there were not any platforms that currently do this. Webber takes a **meta** stance on social media, and allows you to *take a step back* to assess how you are using the internet, including social media. Most tracking applications are focused on looking at the overall time on the internet, and advising you to strictly **cut down** on your usage. Webber is different in that it is not focused on the **quantity** of your usage, but rather the **quality**. In fact, most existing applications aren't even for productivity purposes, but rather to track data usage or privacy and children's safety.

Importantly, Webber adds value by being **fun** to use. I believe this is the core of all social media. Predatory as it may be, all social media should be enjoyable to partake in for the users. If tracking your internet usage can be made fun with Webber, it will become easier to be a conscious internet user, and from the perspective of the application, more enthusiastic users may result in deep insights and analytics into how internet usage in **general** can be improved. Imagine fitness apps that recommend a workout and diet for you, except the workout and diet is fine tuned to perfect your internet usage!

## Comparables

### Obsidian

Mentioned frequently through this assignment so far, Obsidian is a note-taking application that Webber draws heavy inspiration from. This particular image showcases a very useful feature of Obsidian - the power to link thoughts or notes together in a web of connections. This visualization will help to serve as an image for what Webber's main interface might look like.

### Facebook

<br>

</figure>
</div>

This is a screenshot taken from my personal Facebook account - a general purpose social media platform. Other than useful basic utility such as being able to like, comment, or share the post, there is one interesting aspect of this I wish to try and replicate in Webber. That feature is the fact that this wasn't exactly an explicit post that I made to my account. Rather, this "post" was made in response to me changing my profile picture, and it just so happened that I could conveniently add a description to this change. I imagine that Webber will be much of the same. Instead of posts regarding new content, much of what makes Webber tick as a social media platform will be based off of a system of updated to your account, whether that's adding a new link or reacting to someone else's web.

### `alternativeto.com`

<br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 100wh;">
<figure>
  <img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/927366769641922571/1285732567877947454/image.png?ex=66eb5743&is=66ea05c3&hm=0f9eff870c017fd526c9140325a7b669a2d67975e25d0180d9ae9330e24411b1&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1058&height=626'>
</figure>
</div>

This example is from a website called `alternativeto.com`, which aims to give competing options for basically anything. There are several useful features we see in this screenshot, such as the ability to see features, the license model, and even user sentiment through comments about which one is better. The social aspect of Webber can perhaps draw from this type of application.

### Threads

<br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; width: 100wh;">

  <img src='https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/927366769641922571/1285734959314763898/image.png?ex=66eb597e&is=66ea07fe&hm=ef20e135b8555ffaf9a5225e2d40e945193d5654ce59a4e9cec8914c43ab5097&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=1058&height=495'>
</figure>
</div>

Threads is a relatively new competitor to X - I think that the aesthetics of the website are incredibly clean, and the simple feed that gets shown to you is not overwhelming, but shows you enough information such that you are informed on whether you want to click into it and find out more about the social media piece. Everything is very clearly labeled, such as the ability to see which feed you want to be shown being represented as a dropdown at the very top of the screen.

### League of Legends

</figure>
</div>

This screenshot is from a MOBA game called League of Legends. For those of you who are familiar with this game, it might surprise you to see it on this list. However, I believe that there are several amazing takeaways that one can derive from the game. In particular, this screenshot demonstrates a very clear way that one can level up their ability at a given time in this game, by clicking on the flashing marker. In fact, this is how many beginner players play the game until much later. However, more advanced players will know that there exists a keybinding to make this process faster, and not require moving the mouse. There also exists the option to customize and change this keybinding to anything that the user wants. This combination of obvious and complex methods, without cluttering the user space with unneeded information is a design concept that I wish to take to Webber's design as well.

## Feature Ideas

1. **Automatic Link Detection**: Allows for easier and lower barrier to entering new information. Links will be automatically sorted based on either metadata and externally measures similarity scores, or will be user sourced based on what users are manually classifying them as.
2. **Social Web Exploration**: Users will be able to look at other's web's and few them in a similar way to their own to gain inspiration. Ideally this will take place in a feed similar to already existing social media platforms.
3. **Personal Dashboard**: This will be every user's homepage, where they can view their own statistics and web among other things. Importantly, in this specific application, I expect users to use this as more than a homepage for the app. This should be a homepage for the user on the machine - something that the user can have up and running at all times to quickly check in on and see what their internet usage is looking like.
4. **Content Categorization**: Much like the use case above with `alternativeto.com`, users are able to categorize the basic unit of Webber, which is each individual link being put onto the app. These tags could cover a wide range of ideas such as Cooking, Games, Good-UI, etc.
5. **Link Privacy Toggle**: This is a crucial part of the application. There are obviously numerous downsides that come with storing internet usage for someone publicly. A nefarious party could potentially use this information to maliciously hack or otherwise gain access to additional parts of the user's life. Allowing users to toggle which websites, if any, they want displayed to the public is an important consideration that must be made on the user's behalf.
6. **Account Privacy Toggle**: Very similar to above, but instead allows the user to toggle the visibility of their account altogether to an outside source. There may be a good number of users who simply wish to use this app to track their own usage without allowing others access. I would like to support this scenario, even though it definitely is not the norm across the industry.
7. **Timeline View**: An interesting feature that allows users to view their webs as a history on some kind of timeline, serving as a nice visualization on how their account has progressed over time.
8. **Search Functionality**: Search within the application to find other users, webs, or even information about certain categories as discussed above.
9. **Browser Integration**: Although it may require some work in order to have sufficient access to the user's machine, it would be very convenient for the user to simply enable a setting and automatically track their usage instead of having to enter everything manually.
10. **API Access**: Because of the incredibly powerful nature of data that Webber can possess, it would be highly useful if other applications could take advantage and further enhance the user's experience, Thus we expose a common public API that allows for this.
11. **Cross Platform**: A critical requirement if this app is to be used in general, it needs to work and be able to sync data across all major platforms in order to provide the user with the smoothest experience.
12. **Comments**: Hold on, these won't just be any old comments. Webber will do away with the idea of leaving threaded comments, and will instead work on a system where users leave comments in a web, with the center of the web being the user's web.
13. **Data Analytics**: The backend will feature a robust set of statistics and analytics that enhance the user's understanding of their internet usage. This will be displayed on the homepage.
14. **Persistence Rewards**: Like so many other social media platforms, Webber will reward users through some method of having continued usage on the platform, by editing their own profile or reacting to another's profile for consecutive days.
15. **Theme Customization**: More for power users or those who are especially adept with technology, but the option to inject custom CSS to customize the application entirely to how the user wants. This will be very similar to how GTK works with the GNOME desktop.
16. **Offline Access**: Although users will not be able to visit or add new websites while offline, they should nevertheless be able to view their profile to access their insights or perform other administrative actions.
17. **Influence Mapping**: Across the entire website, there should be some overall web with the most impactful and influential webpages that user's own personal webs seem to reflect.
18. **Connecting to Social Media**: Provide users with the ability to connect outside social media. This could allow a couple effects. First this would allow the user to post useful insights from Webber straight to their social media. It could also have the effect of allowing Webber to explore not only tracking website usage, but also WHAT users are doing within those websites, like who they are following or visiting, especially in the case of social media.
19. **Content Ranking**: Similar to how you can find alternatives on `alternativeto.com`, you should be able to look up a category on Webber such as 'Food', and then be able to explore recommendations for the best food websites for you, taking into account what you already have on your web.
20. **Beta Testing \ Feedback**: An important part of any application should be to allow users to give input on what the future of the application they are using should look like. Similar to Spotify's experimental features, user's should be able to opt into bleeding edge features, especially early into development, where the velocity of the project is expected to be the highest.

## VSD Analysis

### Observation 1

Stakeholders (Variation in Human Ability) and Webber's Webs

Despite discussing it in class, as I was reading this point I was reminded that I had not in the slightest even tried to think about what this user experience would be like for those without any sight, or greatly impaired vision. It doesn't necessarily have to be that I make a dedication to supporting these users, but I should at least be conscious of them. Part of the magic of these webs is being able to see their complexity and the deep connections they offer to our eyes. I was unable to think of a way to get this across in a verbal manner. For that reason, I believe that it would be best for Webber to update the target user base with the caveat that we are not accommodating for the visually impaired.

### Observation 2

Stakeholders (Non-targeted Use) and Webber's Information Collection

I started to think about these possibilities, but one very scary implication of collecting so much user data is that there will certainly be malicious third parties that desperately want access to this information. It would serve Webber well to have public code of honor that it lives by, and that future stakeholders can refer to when it comes to what Webber stands for. I assume that this issue is tangential from privacy, as that entails a whole other set of details to consider. There could also be a strong user policy that very clearly details what users can and cannot do, giving clear conditions to ban or remove your account of it is deemed nefarious.

### Observation 3

Time (Long-Term Health and Well-Being) and Webber as a Social Media Application

As with many social media applications, there is always the risk that it can become addictive or even further damaging to an individual's life. You could easily imagine a scenario with Webber where someone's internet usage actually ends up being worse because they spend too much time on the application, obsessing over how to optimize their usage. A potential fix to this could be putting usage warnings into the application or otherwise limiting usage per day / designing the UI in a way that does not promote social media addiction, opposite to most social media.

### Observation 4

Pervasiveness (Accounting for Culture) and Webber's Overall Statistics

Although this issue is not exactly the way that the prompt words it, it is still very closely related - how should Webber account for users in different cultures when displaying overall statistics or recommendations? For example, it would be much more interesting to a user what the most frequently visited website among their friends is rather than the entire world. Similarly, it may be more prudent for Webber to take region or culture into account when displaying anything, perhaps even having different data servers for each region or country.

### Observation 5

Values (Value Tensions) and Webber's Presentation

Webber needs to balance around a thin line when it comes to it's presentation. Users might be coming to Webber with the expectation that it is going to nicely tell them how to use the internet better. However, after analyzing information, Webber might present the result in a way that makes the users feel offended or perhaps even in disagreement with what the application is presenting. To prevent this, it is important to think carefully not only about Webber as an analytical product, but also as a human facing product that needs to be conscious that there is a user with feelings and values who is using the application. Sugar coating or presenting information nicely can result in a much more pleasant overall user experience without diminishing the returns gained from the app.
