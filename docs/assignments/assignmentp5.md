# Design Revisions:
Abandoned labeling and achievementing because we wanted to spend more time making sure the core concepts of the app work correctly and well. It doesn’t affect our impact case that much, because achievementing was used to encourage users to use the app and labeling was an idea that came from the VSD analysis.
We also decided to allow the user to both search and filter by type of clothing within a closet. In P3, we envisioned doing this separately somehow to make it not too complicated, but it makes more intuitive sense to do both at the same time.
We decided to only let people submit one outfit per challenge to make sure that people don’t spam submissions. This allows them to put more thought into the one outfit they create.

# User Testing
<!--## User List-->
We plan to interview three participants, who are all potential users of our system.
1. Ella Choi
2. Will Walling-Sotolongo 
3. Elijah Van Ryck de Groot - isn’t very interested in fashion but has expressed interest in getting help selecting outfits for more important occasions to make a good impression.


## Task List
Note - due to the nature of our app’s main functionality requiring a lot of user-submitted data, we chose to give our users a test account with closets pre-populated with clothes so that they could test the full functionality of Outfinity without having to populate a bunch of clothes themselves.








| Task Name        |  Instruction  |  Rationale |
| -------------    | ----------- | ---- |
| Login | Sign into the website with the username: test and password: test. | Logging in is very important, because a user must do it before they can access all of the features of the app. This is a warmup/starter task. |
| View Closet | Look at what clothes you own. | Is it obvious that clothes would be in the closets menu? Can users intuit what a main closet means (i.e. that it is all of their clothes)? Do users realize they can click on clothing items to open a page with details and notes? |
| Upload Clothing  | Add your favorite piece of clothing. | We want to see if it’s obvious that users would create clothing from the Closet menu, and we also want to see how intuitive the picture link upload system is so we know if we should provide more guidance. |
| Create Outfit | Put together an outfit using your clothes. | Is how to create an outfit intuitive? How do users interact with the different menus for types of clothing? Do users need more features, such as the ability to upload jewelry? Is it obvious how to delete and stack clothing? |
| Enter Challenge | Create an outfit for someone else on Outfinity. | We want to see if users can make the connection between the Challenges terminology and the idea of styling someone else. We also want to see if the difference between an outfit for a challenge and an outfit create for yourself is clear to users. |
| Create Challenge | Imagine you have a big work presentation coming up, and you’re not sure what to wear. How would you go about getting advice on what to wear from other people using Outfinity? | We want to see if users can successfully figure out how to make a challenge (from the My Challenges menu) and also see if they can figure out what the name and description fields of the challenge mean. We also want to see if users know where to find their currently active challenges. |
| End Challenge | (After submitting some entries to the user’s contest) Select an outfit to wear. | We want to see if the idea of a winner makes sense to users, and we also want to test to see if the idea of saving outfits vs. picking a winner of a challenge makes sense (that is, ideally, the user would like more than one of the entries and figure out they can save outfits to their outfits list and select multiple winners). |
| Create Minicloset | Imagine you’re going to college and you’re leaving some clothes behind at home. How do you allow people to style you with only the clothes you have? | We want to see if the minicloset idea is intuitive and also to see if creating miniclosets is intuitive from the Closets menu. |
