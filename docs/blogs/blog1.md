# Design that Matters

Lyel's lecture today really drove home the importance of direction before design - it was a great complement to our focus on value sensitive design in the class, but also left me wondering how it might fit into existing models of development. In particular, I thought about what it means to take a philosophy that prioritizes design and weigh it against other paradigms such as "move fast and break things".

## Moving Fast

It's often the case that developing quickly is seen as a virtue in the tech industry. The last two companies I worked at put an emphasis on the flexibility and speed of their development. This manifested in the adoption of new technology and rapid turnarounds on deploying new systems. The idea here is to resist complacency and to always be pushing ahead, even at the cost of minor setbacks. In general, the sentiment is very similar to the saying that the best way to learn is to make mistakes. Rather than perfect or overthink about a design, the best way is to get it out there, test it, receive feedback, and iterate. Fundamentally, this reasonable philosophy seems at odds with directed development.

## Moving with Intent

Moving with direction and intent seems to have a tangible tradeoff that is usually negative on first glance - either an increase in time, decrease in productivity and profit, or any combination of factors that stakeholders might value. On the surface, it seems like a clear clash with the idea of moving fast and breaking things. However, it also seems wrong to say we should disregard this as a secondary aspect. Moving with direction **is** important in software as otherwise developers suffer the same fate we saw in lecture today with Facebook.

## Balance

So the question is how do we balance these two ideas? As Lyel mentioned, there are ways to weigh the impact each design has on the overall development process. We can prioritize elements on the axes of feasibility and risk, and select them as needed. Despite being a good workaround, the two ideas still fundamentally stand at odds. One cannot come without diminishing the other, and it appears that they stand on opposite ends of the same spectrum.

This is a question I'm still thinking about, and I don't have a great answer. It seems reasonable to me that separation, while still coupled, might be the best way to marry these two concepts. When development needs to be fast, you move without any other concerns. However, once that sprint is done, it's time to come back and regroup. To talk about the direction that the project went in and how to align it to the values you desire. This way, you can have the best of both worlds - rapid development and a clear direction. Of course, this approach isn't without its sacrifices either, namely additional time.

However for large companies in particular, I imagine that an injecting these "direction review checks", even on a small scale, would make a large difference. With the incredible number of parallel projects that these companies have running at once, it's often enough to nudge the overall company in the right direction by critically thinking about only a fraction of the total projects. Imagine balancing a stick on your hand - it's not that hard as long as you respond to slight movements in the stick. The moment you ignore the warning signs for too long, there is nothing you can do to prevent the stick from falling.
